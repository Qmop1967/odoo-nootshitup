# ðŸ§  Copilot Instruction: Product Image Sync from Zoho to Odoo

# When syncing product data from Zoho to Odoo, you must also:
# 1. Fetch the product image from Zoho. This could be a URL or binary file depending on the API.
# 2. Convert or encode the image properly to match Odoo's requirements (e.g., base64 if using XML-RPC).
# 3. Attach the image to the product record in Odoo.
# 4. If the image already exists in Odoo and has not changed, do not re-upload it.
# 5. Log the image sync status (success, skipped, or failed) for each product.
#
# The image must be linked to the appropriate product using its unique identifier (e.g., SKU or default_code).
